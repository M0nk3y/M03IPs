## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the M03IP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for M03IPs that want to change the world. It should clearly explain why the existing structure and function of civilization is inadequate to address the problem that the M03IP solves. M03IP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe in technical detail any new feature, functionality, process, policy, business model, product, service, or other cryptoeconomic system enhancement being proposed. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations by any software developer or Decentralized Hedge Fund Manager who decides to implement the M03IP.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the cryptoeconomic engineering design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the proposal addresses international regulatory compliance concerns. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Implementations
The implementations must be completed before any M03IP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the M03IP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of technical details.
